#+TITLE: Consul Operations
#+LATEX: \pagebreak

* Overview

  This repository includes scripts for deploying Consul.

* Notable Features

  Given appropriate permissions, this installation plays very nicely with
  AutoScaling Groups. It does this by using the AWS API to find hints about how it
  should configure itself.

  The minimum number of instances in the autoscaling group is assumed to be the
  minimum size of the Consul cluster, and all nodes are started with the
  ~bootstrap_expect~ parameter set accordingly.

  Other instances in the same autoscaling group are assumed to be peers. The IP
  address of each instance in the autoscaling group is added to the ~retry_join~
  configuration parameter.

  The name of the autoscaling group will be used as the ~datacenter~
  configuration parameter. Any spaces will be converted to dashes.

  Together, these address the problem of bootstrapping a Consul cluster in a
  reproducible manner, without introducing much complexity.

* Requirements

** openssl

   Required to use ~consul~.

** unzip

   HashiCorp distributes ~consul~ artifacts as ZIP archives, so you'll need this
   to unpack them.

** git

   This is a ~git~ repository. Cloning it is the standard way of consuming it.
   You could fetch it another way, if you really didn't want ~git~. This would
   be unsupported.

** awscli

   Used for interacting with the AWS API. This is not required if ~AUTOSCALING~
   is ~false~.

** jq

   Used for parsing AWS API responses. This is not required if ~AUTOSCALING~ is
   ~false~.

** IAM Permissions

   If ~AUTOSCALING~ is not ~false~, the cluster will be bootstrapped using some
   hints from the AWS API. It needs a few permissions to do this. An example of
   a policy that would meet these requirements can be found under the
   =example/iam/policy/= directory of this repository.

   | Permission                                 | Purpose                                                         |
   |--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
   | =autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups=    | Used to identify the autoscaling group the instance belongs to. |
   | =autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingInstances= | Used to identify peers in the autoscaling group.                |
   | =ec2:DescribeInstances=                    | Used to identify the IP addresseses of peers.                   |

* scripts/install

  Creates a =consul= user, installs Consul, and installs a systemd service.
